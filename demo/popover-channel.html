        <h1>The Mother Road</h1>
        <p>A 2,448-mile love letter to the American West</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="content-body">
    
    <p>Established in 1926, Route 66—often called the "Mother Road"—served as the primary artery for those heading West during the Dust Bowl and the post-war tourism boom. Stretching from the shores of Lake Michigan in Chicago to the Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica, it spans eight states and three time zones. Today, it remains a living museum of American kitsch, neon lights, and the spirit of the open road.</p>

    <div class="date-marker">The First Leg</div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Leaving the Skyscrapers Behind</h2>
    
    <p>My journey began under the shadow of the Willis Tower in Chicago. The first few days are a study in transition. You watch the steel and glass of the city dissolve into the brick-and-mortar reality of the Illinois heartland. By the time I hit Missouri, the air had changed. It felt thicker, smelling of damp limestone and diesel.</p>

    <p>In Oklahoma, the road opens up. This is where you find the Blue Whale of Catoosa, a giant turquoise monument to mid-century whimsy. It stands as a reminder that Route 66 wasn't just built for commerce; it was built for the sheer joy of seeing something you’d never seen before.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
        "The road is a way of being. It’s not just a path between two points, but a state of mind that rewards the slow and the curious."
    </div>

    <div class="date-marker">Midway Through</div>
    <h2 class="section-title">The High Plains & Neon Sunsets</h2>

    <p>Texas is where the scale of the West truly hits you. Crossing the Panhandle, the horizon stretches so far you can practically see the curvature of the earth. I stopped at the Midpoint Café in Adrian—the mathematical center of the route—for a slice of "ugly crust" pie. From there, it was a straight shot into the neon glow of New Mexico.</p>

    <p>Tucumcari is a town that refuses to let the 1950s die. At night, the Blue Swallow Motel flickers to life with a buzzing neon hum that feels like a heartbeat. I spent hours just watching the signs, realizing that while the interstate took the traffic away, it couldn't take the soul out of these places.</p>

    <div class="date-marker">The Final Descent</div>
    <h2 class="section-title">The Mojave and the Pier</h2>

    <p>The last week was a gauntlet of heat and high desert. Arizona brought the Petrified Forest—ancient logs turned to multicolored stone—and a detour to the Grand Canyon that served as a humbling reminder of nature’s clock versus our own. Then came the Mojave. Driving through California’s desert in a car with questionable AC is a rite of passage.</p>

    <p>But then, the air changed. The scent of sagebrush was replaced by the bracing salt of the Pacific. Rolling onto the Santa Monica Pier on Day 21 felt like waking up from a long, vivid dream. I stood under the "End of the Trail" sign, looking at my car—caked in the dust of eight states—and realized I didn't want the drive to end.</p>
